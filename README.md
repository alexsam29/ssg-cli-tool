# ssg-cli-tool

A command-line interface Static Site Generator (SSG) used for generating a complete HTML web site from raw data and files.

## Overview

This tool allows a user to input a text or markdown file path or a directory path and an HTML file will be created for the specified file or for every text/markdown file in the specified directory.

## Requirements

A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be downloaded and installed.

## Instructions

1.  Clone or download the repository on to your local machine. Remember the file location!
2.  Open a terminal or command window and move to the directory where the repository was downloaded to.
3.  Before running the tool, run the command `npm install` followed by `npm install -g` to install npm packages and install the tool globally.
4.  Run the SSG tool by inputting a file or folder path.

```
ssg -i file_path
```

5.  If a file was specified, an HTML file will be created and added into the `dist` directory. If a directory was specified, HTML files will be created for every text/markdown file in the directory and they will be added into the `dist` directory.
6.  [OPTIONAL] Specify a directory to output the HTML files to by adding the path as a second argument. If the directory does not exist, a new one will be created. If it does exist, the current contents will be deleted and only the HTML files will be added.

```
ssg -i file_path -o directoryPath
```

NOTE: This will <b>DELETE the specified directory</b> and create a new one with the same name. <b>DO NOT SPECIFY A DIRECTORY WITH IMPORTANT FILES</b>.

## Examples

### Generate HTML file based off a text or markdown file

```
ssg -i file_path
```

Add `" "` for files with spaces.

```
ssg -i ".\testFiles\Silver Blaze.txt"
```

```
ssg -i ".\testFiles\input MD.md"
```

### Generate HTML files based off of text or markdown files within a directory

```
ssg -i .\testFiles
```

Add `" "` for directories with spaces.

```
ssg -i ".\test Files"
```

### Specify the output directory

Any existing contents in the directory will be <b>DELETED</b>.

For a File:

```
ssg -i ".\testFiles\Silver Blaze.txt" -o .\anotherFolder
```

For a directory:

```
ssg -i .\testFiles -o .\anotherFolder
```

## Optional Features Implemented

-   Title parsed from text and markdown files. It will populate the `<title>` tag and add a `<h1>` tag to the top of the body.
-   Allow the user to specify a different output directory using --output or -o. If not specified, dist will be used, but if the user specifies a different output path, it will use that. If the directory does not exist, a new directory will be created.
-   If the user specifies a folder for the input, it will automatically generate an index.html file, which has relative links to each of the generated HTML files.
-   Italicized text parsed from markdown files. It will add a `<i>` tag to any italicized text.
-   Bold text parsed from markdown files. It will add a `<strong>` tag to any bold text.
